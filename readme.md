# K-Anonymity Data Science Task

A repository for a take-home task that I was asked to do for a Data Scientist role in 2021. No guarantees that anything here will run, I'm just chucking it here as it's a piece of work that I'm proud of. A large part of the role was working with LaTeX to produce high-quality reports for clients, and although LaTeX was not a requirement for the task, I thought it would be good to demonstrate my ability to use it.
